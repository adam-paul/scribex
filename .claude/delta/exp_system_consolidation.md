# ScribeX Delta Summary: XP System Consolidation

## Overview

This delta summary documents the consolidation of the parallel points and XP systems into a single unified XP system. The changes simplify the codebase by removing unnecessary duplication and establish a consistent reward mechanism across the application.

## Key Changes

### Types and Interfaces

- Modified `UserProgress` interface to use `totalXp` instead of `totalScore`
- Removed the `achievements` field from the interface as this feature is no longer used
- Updated related types to align with the consolidated system

### Store Implementation

- Updated the `addPoints` method to `addXp` for semantic clarity
- Renamed `calculateXP` to `calculateLevelFromXp` to reflect its focused purpose
- Modified the `updateUserProfileFromProgress` method to directly use `totalXp` 
- Ensured persistence layer correctly uses `totalXp` field

### UI and Components

- Updated `ProgressHeader` component to display XP instead of points
- Modified profile screen to show consolidated XP value
- Updated success messages in exercise completion to reference XP instead of points

### Synchronization Logic

- Simplified synchronization between local progress store and server profile
- Ensured the server `xp` field and local `totalXp` field are kept in sync

## Benefits

1. **Simplified Mental Model**: Users now have a single progress metric to understand
2. **Reduced Code Complexity**: Removed duplicate calculations and conversion logic
3. **Improved Data Consistency**: Single source of truth for experience points
4. **Better Maintainability**: Less code to maintain with unified reward system

## Implementation Notes

The consolidation maintains full compatibility with existing level progression logic. The user experience remains consistent, with XP values scaled appropriately to maintain the same sense of progression that existed in the previous dual-system approach.
