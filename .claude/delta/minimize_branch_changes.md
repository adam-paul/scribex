# ScribeX Delta Summary: `minimize` Branch Changes

## Overview

This delta summary analyzes changes between the main branch and the current `minimize` branch. The changes focus on three key areas: AI integration improvements, authentication fixes, and code minimization efforts.

## AI Integration and Background Question Generation

### Key Changes

- **Background Exercise Loading**: Added new functionality to preload exercises in the background, improving user experience by having exercises ready when needed
  - Added AppState listener in `app/_layout.tsx` to resume exercise preloading when app returns to foreground
  - Implemented a structured approach to exercise generation with the `preloadAllLessons` method in `lesson-store.ts`
  - Enhanced question generation with type-specific prompts in `ai-service.ts`

- **Exercise Loading Optimization**: 
  - Modified `[id].tsx` to use cached exercises first and only generate new ones when needed
  - Implemented a fallback mechanism that works even when few exercises are available
  - Added sequential loading of different exercise types (multiple-choice, fill-in-blank, matching, reorder)

- **Rate Limiting Improvements**:
  - Fixed a bug in `ai-service.ts` where rate limiting wasn't properly clearing older requests
  - Improved the `checkRateLimit` function to maintain a sliding window of requests

## Authentication Fixes

### Key Changes

- **Sign-Out Process**: 
  - Fixed an issue where sign-out wasn't properly clearing cached data
  - Added explicit state reset before signout to prevent data persistence issues
  - Added clearing of sync timers to prevent background operations after logout

- **Auth Flow Simplification**:
  - Reduced duplicated code in authentication flow
  - Improved session detection and user state management
  - Added better error handling for auth operations

- **Data Loading Optimization**:
  - Implemented parallel data loading with Promise.all for faster load times
  - Added automatic cache clearing on sign-out to ensure fresh data on next login
  - Improved profile creation for new users

## Code Minimization

### Key Changes

- **Reduced Code Duplication**:
  - Simplified the state synchronization code in `AuthContext.tsx`
  - Removed redundant functions and consolidated similar operations
  - Streamlined progress checking in multiple components

- **Optimized Component Rendering**:
  - Improved memoization to prevent unnecessary re-renders
  - Added targeted component updates based on authentication status

- **Performance Improvements**:
  - Added delay for background tasks to prioritize UI responsiveness
  - Implemented smarter exercise caching to reduce API calls
  - Added automatic clearing of old exercise data (older than 7 days)

## Implementation Notes

These changes address several key challenges:

1. Exercise availability during user sessions now works more reliably with background loading
2. Authentication edge cases are handled more gracefully
3. The application is more responsive due to code optimization and reduced duplication

The changes maintain full compatibility with the existing architecture while improving reliability and performance.
