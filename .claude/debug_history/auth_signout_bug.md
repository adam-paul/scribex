# Debug History: Authentication Sign-Out Bug

## Error Description
Users reported being unable to completely sign out of the application. After signing out and then reopening the app, users would sometimes find themselves automatically logged back in, or in a corrupted state where the UI showed they were logged out but exercise progress and writing projects from their previous session were still visible.

## Context
- **Version**: 1.2.3
- **Affected Components**: AuthContext.tsx, supabase-service.ts
- **Symptoms**:
  - Automatic re-login after explicit sign-out
  - Missing user data but session persistence
  - Writing projects from previous user visible to new user
  - Exercise progress not properly reset

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was identified in the `signOut` method of AuthContext.tsx:

```typescript
// Original problematic code
const signOut = async () => {
  try {
    await supabaseService.signOut();
    setUser(null);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error signing out:', error);
  }
};
```

Two critical issues were identified:
1. The order of operations was incorrect - setting the user to null should happen after successful signout
2. The stores (progress-store, writing-store, lesson-store) were not being properly reset before signout

This created a race condition where:
1. The Supabase signOut process started
2. The user state was immediately set to null
3. But Zustand persisted stores weren't reset
4. AsyncStorage still contained stale data
5. On next app open, restored state contained a mix of logged out user but persisted data

## Solution

The fix involved:
1. Correctly ordering the signOut operations
2. Adding explicit store resets before signout
3. Adding a specific error handler for signout failures

```typescript
// Fixed implementation
const signOut = async () => {
  try {
    // First reset local stores to prevent persisted data staying around
    useProgressStore.getState().resetProgress();
    useWritingStore.getState().setProjects([]);
    useLessonStore.getState().clearAllExercises();
    
    // Then sign out from Supabase
    const success = await supabaseService.signOut();
    
    if (success) {
      // Only set user to null after successful signout
      setUser(null);
    } else {
      throw new Error('Supabase signOut returned false');
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error signing out:', error);
    // Even on error, clear the user state for UI consistency
    setUser(null);
  }
};
```

Additionally, a check was added to the supabase-service.ts signOut method to ensure the auth session was fully cleared:

```typescript
// Enhanced signOut in supabase-service.ts
async signOut(): Promise<boolean> {
  try {
    const { error } = await this.supabase.auth.signOut();
    
    if (error) {
      console.error('Supabase signOut error:', error);
      return false;
    }
    
    // Clear any remaining session data
    this.user = null;
    
    // Verify session is truly gone
    const { data } = await this.supabase.auth.getSession();
    if (data.session) {
      console.warn('Session persisted after signOut, forcing removal');
      // Force clear session storage as fallback
      if (Platform.OS === 'web' && typeof localStorage !== 'undefined') {
        localStorage.removeItem('supabase.auth.token');
      } else {
        await AsyncStorage.removeItem('supabase.auth.token');
      }
      return false;
    }
    
    return true;
  } catch (e) {
    console.error('Exception during signOut:', e);
    return false;
  }
}
```

## Verification

The fix was verified by:
1. Testing sign out and re-opening the app multiple times
2. Verifying no user data persisted between sessions
3. Checking AsyncStorage to ensure all auth tokens were properly cleared
4. Testing on both iOS and Android devices
5. Testing on web platform with localStorage inspection

## Prevention Measures

To prevent similar issues in the future:
1. Added clear documentation about the proper signout flow
2. Added a more comprehensive test for the authentication cycle
3. Implemented a background check on app startup to verify auth state consistency
4. Added logging for auth state transitions in development builds
